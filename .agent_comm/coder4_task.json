Here, we present a reduced-order numerical and experimental framework for a\nbilayer system consisting of a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic sheet (Shrinky Dink) bonded to a\nkirigami-patterned, inert plastic layer. Upon uniform heating, the active layer contracts while the\npatterned layer constrains in-plane stretch but allows out-of-plane bending, yielding programmable\n3D morphologies from simple planar precursors. Our approach enables efficient computational design\nand scalable manufacturing of 3D forms with a single-layer reduced model that captures the coupled\nmechanics of stretching and bending. Unlike traditional bilayer modeling, our framework collapses\nthe multilayer composite into a single layer of nodes and elements, reducing the degrees of freedom\nand enabling simulation on a 2D geometry. This is achieved by introducing a novel energy formulation\nthat captures the coupling between in-plane stretch mismatch and out-of-plane bending\u2014extending\nbeyond simple isotropic linear elastic models. Experimentally, we establish a fully planar, repeatable\nfabrication protocol using a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic and a laser-cut inert plastic layer. The\nprogrammed strain mismatch drives an array of 3D morphologies, such as bowls, canoes, and flower\npetals, all verified by both simulation and physical prototypes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRapid and cost-effective manufacturing of 3D structures from planar 2D materials is challenging and the manufacturing\nmethods are in significant demand in fields such as soft robotics, automobile manufacturing, biomedical devices,\naerospace components, and deployable structures. The existing structures fabricated from active and responsive\nmaterials have enabled applications in aerospace [ 1\u20133], medicine [ 4\u20136], and intelligent machines [ 7,8], but they remain\nprimarily material-focused. There is a growing need for scalable manufacturing frameworks that can accelerate\nreal-world deployment. In this context, computational design \u2013 particularly approaches that enable rapid simulation\nand optimization \u2013 plays a pivotal role. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a reduced computational\nmodel that enables efficient, accurate simulation of shape-morphing composites, leveraging algorithms originally\ndeveloped in the computer graphics community [9].\nA variety of pathways have been explored to drive shape morphing, including tailored material designs [ 10], composite\nstructures [ 11,12], microstructurally engineered polymers [ 13\u201315], origami-inspired mechanisms [ 16,17], and architected\nmetastructures [ 18\u201320]. The transformation from 2D to 3D forms is governed by the interplay between stretching and\nbending [ 21], where strain mismatches embedded in planar preforms can lead to a variety of 3D shapes [ 13,22\u201324]. In\nparticular, bilayer composites comprising a stimuli-responsive material bonded to a patterned kirigami layer [ 25] offer\na scalable,\nmanufacturing-driven strategy for programmable shape morphing across a broad range of applications, such as\ndeployable structures, patient-specific biomedical devices, and adaptive surfaces. In this work, we use a bilayer\nsystem composed of a Shrinky Dink thermoplastic and an inert kirigami-patterned plastic as a model platform for\nprogrammable morphable surfaces. Our reduced-order numerical method, demonstrated on this system, can be readily\naugmented to simulate and guide the design of other classes of shape-morphing composite shells.\nIn this paper, we introduce a numerical framework for efficient and accurate prediction of stimulus-driven 3D shape\nmorphing in bilayer composite shells. Unlike conventional approaches that require explicit modeling of multiple layers,\nwe represent the entire layered composite using a single layer of nodes and formulate an effective energy model that\ncaptures the coupled mechanics of the bilayer system. Our method builds on the discrete shells approach [ 9], where the\ntotal elastic energy of a thin structure is computed from in-plane stretching (changes in edge lengths) and out-of-plane\nbending (dihedral angles between adjacent triangular elements), each referenced to rest lengths and rest angles that\ndefine the undeformed, stress-free configuration. We advance this framework by allowing these rest lengths and restarXiv:2508.08198v1  [cs.GR]  11 Aug 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n2\nExp.   Sim. Exp.   Sim. Exp.

This\nenergy-based approach yields accurate predictions of complex 3D configurations arising from 2D patterned precursors,\nwithout resorting to computationally expensive full 3D simulations. We validate our framework by comparing numerical\npredictions to physical experiments on bilayer composites composed of a heat-shrinking thermoplastic (Shrinky Dink)\nand a layer of 3D printed PLA (polylactic acid).\nFigure 1 shows representative 3D shapes fabricated in physical experiments (left) and their numerically simulated\ncounterparts (right).

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we study three representative kirigami patterns and\nanalyze their resulting 3D shapes through both numerical simulations and physical experiments. We quantify the\ndifferences between the simulated and experimental shapes at various stages of the stimulus, and find excellent\nagreement, thereby validating the predictive capability of our framework.\nII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Emergent 3D Shapes via Planar Fabrication of Bilayer Composites\nThe experimental approach exploits the rapid contraction of thermally responsive polystyrene (Shrinky Dink)\ntogether with the geometric programmability enabled by 3D printing. Polystyrene is selected for its reliable shrinkage\n(up to 60% reduction in length), low cost, and safe processing in standard laboratory ovens. The shrinkage ratio can\nbe precisely tuned by adjusting the heating time, providing an additional degree of control over the final shape. For\nprogrammable morphing, we digitally design and directly 3D print the inert plastic (PLA) layer in the desired kirigami\npattern \u2013 a network of openings and solid regions that enables localized bending and selectively constrains shrinkage.\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n3\nThis additive manufacturing approach ensures high precision and reproducibility, which are difficult to achieve with\nmanual cutting methods such as scissors. The patterned PLA is then bonded to the polystyrene sheet, allowing for\nspatial control of deformation and a customizable mechanical response.\nFigure 2 presents three representative examples demonstrating the morphing of 3D shapes from planar bilayer\ncomposites via thermal actuation. In the first row, panels A(i)\u2013C(i) show physical scans of the digitally designed\ninert kirigami layer (solid black regions) alongside the shapes of the Shrinky Dink substrate (dashed boundaries) for\neach 2D precursor, while panels A(ii)-C(ii) display the corresponding numerical meshes. The second row shows the\nresulting physical and numerically simulated 3D shapes. Depending on the kirigami pattern, the flat 2D precursor\nundergoes stimulus-driven transformation in the oven to form a variety of 3D shapes, such as a bowl, a canoe, and\nflower petals. The close agreement between the experimentally scanned shapes and the simulation results demonstrates\nthe predictive capability of our numerical framework.\nA(i)            A(ii)           B(i)               B(ii)               C(i)           C(ii)\nExp.

The first\nrow shows the 2D designs: each design consists of a specific kirigami pattern (PLA layer) on a thermoplastic (Shrinky Dink)\nsubstrate of defined shape. The second row displays the resulting 3D shapes. Subfigures A, B, and C correspond to three\nrepresentative cases: bowl, canoe, and flower petal morphologies, respectively. For each design, the left column (i) presents\nresults from physical experiments, and the right column (ii) shows the corresponding numerical simulations using the new energy\nmodel in Equation 6.\nTo fabricate the morphable bilayer composites, we first design a kirigami pattern for the PLA layer based on\nheuristics that relate the pattern geometry to the intended 3D morphed shape. The chosen pattern is then digitally\nmodeled and 3D printed as a thin PLA structure. This PLA layer is bonded to the polystyrene (Shrinky Dink) sheet\nusing a two-part Gorilla epoxy. The high bending and stretching stiffness of PLA constrains shrinkage in the bonded\nregions, allowing the patterned geometry to locally direct where in-plane contraction is allowed or resisted. As a result,\nthe composite exhibits spatially varying stiffness, which can be further tuned by adjusting the thickness of the PLA\nlayer to achieve complex 3D surfaces.\nFigure 3 illustrates the complete fabrication process. First, the kirigami pattern is designed based on the desired\nfinal shape; for example, Figure 3A shows a six-arm star on a circular thermoplastic sheet. The pattern is then digitally\nmodeled with the prescribed thickness using Fusion [ 26] and fabricated by 3D printing, as shown in Figure 3B. Next,\nthe printed PLA pattern is bonded to a precisely cut thermoplastic substrate, and the assembled bilayer composite is\ncured for over 10 hours to ensure robust adhesion (Figure 3C). After curing, thermal actuation is used to induce shape\nmorphing, as shown in Figure 3D, by heating the planar composite in an oven for approximately 15 seconds. The\nresponse of the Shrinky Dink layer is characterized by measuring its shrinkage as a function of normalized temperature\n(Figure 3E), where the temperature is scaled by the glass transition temperature ( Tg) of polystyrene, an amorphous\nthermoplastic without a sharp melting point. The sheet begins to shrink when T/Tg>1 (temperatures are measured\nin Kelvins), but the shrink ratio L/L 0does not stabilize until it exceeds 1.15, corresponding to temperatures above\n300\u25e6F, as indicated by a vertical dashed line in Figure 3E. Consequently, all experiments are performed at temperatures\ngreater than 300\u25e6F.\nUsing this protocol, we explored a range of additively manufactured patterns with varying dimensions and sheet\nshapes. This paper highlights three representative designs (Figure 1A\u2013C), each defined by a distinct combination of\nsubstrate domain and kirigami pattern: (A) a six-arm star kirigami pattern on a circular Shrinky Dink substrate, (B)\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n4\na two-star kirigami pattern on a rectangular substrate, and (C) a cross kirigami pattern on a square substrate. After\nthermal activation at 300\u25e6F for approximately 15 seconds, the planar composites reliably morph into 3D shapes, which\nare then reconstructed and analyzed through 3D scanning. In the following section, we present our numerical method\nfor predicting these experimentally observed 3D shapes.\nA                    B                              E\nC                    D\n0.8 1 1.2\nNormalized Temperature, T/Tg00.20.40.60.81Normalized Length, L/L0\n300oF x-axis\ny-axis\nFIG. 3: Experimental setup.

Numerical Simulation with a Reduced Model\nMotivated by the experimental observations of programmable shape morphing in bilayer composites \u2013 comprising\na 3D printed PLA kirigami layer bonded to a Shrinky Dink sheet \u2013 we propose a new energy formulation that\ncouples planar stretching with out-of-plane deformation. We first briefly review the discrete elastic shells method in\nSection II B 1, and then introduce our reduced energy model for composite shells in Section II B 2.\n1. Discrete Elastic Shells method\nThe discrete elastic shells framework provides a discrete differential geometry-based approach for modeling thin shells,\nwhere the thickness is much smaller than the in-plane dimensions. In this formulation, the structure is represented as\na triangular mesh with Nnodes connected by Needges, as shown in Figure 4 . The specific meshes used to simulate\nthe three representative examples in this work are shown in Figures 4A\u2013C. Each node (e.g., a, b, c, d in Figure 4D) has\nthree spatial degrees of freedom, corresponding to its position in 3D space, and the full configuration is described by\nthe vector Xof size 3 N. An edge is the connection between two nodes, labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 4D. Edges\nthat are shared by two triangles are referred to as hinges (for example, edge 0 is the common edge of triangles abcand\nadb). The mesh contains Nhsuch hinges. At every hinge, the angle between the normals of the adjacent triangles is\ndefined as the dihedral angle. Edges can undergo stretching, and hinges can undergo bending; these deformations store\nstretching and bending energies, respectively. The corresponding elastic energy expressions are introduced later in this\nsection.\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n5\nThe equations of motion for the DOF vector Xare given by\nM\u00a8X+\u2207E=Fext, (1)\nwhereMis the (diagonal) mass matrix, \u02d9Xand\u00a8Xdenote the first and second time derivatives of X,\u2207Eis the gradient\nof the total elastic energy with respect to the DOF vector (i.e., the negative of the elastic force), and Fextis the\nexternal force vector. To advance the simulation from t=tktotk+1=tk+ \u2206t, we employ the implicit Euler method\nand discretize Equation 1 as\nM1\n\u2206t\u0012X(tk+1)\u2212X(tk)\n\u2206t\u2212\u02d9X(tk)\u0013\n+\u2207E(X(tk+1)) =Fext(tk+1). (2)\nGiven the positions X(tk) and velocities \u02d9X(tk) at the previous time step, the new positions X(tk+1) are computed by\nsolving this nonlinear system via the Newton\u2013Raphson method. The Jacobian matrix for each Newton iteration is\nJ=M\n\u2206t2+\u22072E(X)\u2212 \u2207Fext, (3)\nwhere \u22072Eis the Hessian of the elastic energy with respect to nodal positions. Since our study focuses on the static\nequilibrium shape, the inertial term M\u00a8Xis neglected and the external force Fext(tk+1) is set to zero. In this case, the\nfinal configuration corresponds to a minimum of the total elastic energy. The velocity at tk+1can be calculated simply\nfrom \u02d9X(tk+1) = (X(tk+1)\u2212X(tk))/\u2206t.\nIn the discrete shells framework, the total elastic energy is the sum of stretching energies (associated with each\nedge) and bending energies (associated with each hinge) [27]:\nE\u0000\nX\u0001\n=NeX\ni=11\n2ks\u03b52\ni+NhX\nj=11\n2kb\u0000\n\u03b8j\u2212\u00af\u03b8j\u00012, (4)\nwhere \u03b5i(axial strain for edge i) and \u03b8j(dihedral angle at hinge j) are defined below as macroscopic, geometrically\ninvariant strain measures, and \u00af\u03b8jdenotes the rest dihedral angle at hinge j, i.e., the dihedral angle in the reference\n(undeformed) configuration. For a flat plate, \u00af\u03b8j= 0, while for a curved shell, \u00af\u03b8jmay be nonzero and spatially varying.\nThe strains are fully determined by the DOF vector Xand are invariant with respect to the global coordinate\nsystem. Specifically, the axial strain for each edge is \u03b5i=li/l0,i\u22121, where liis the current edge length and l0,iis its\nrest (reference) length in the undeformed mesh. The dihedral angle \u03b8jis defined as the angle between the normals of\nthe two triangles sharing hinge j. The stretching and bending stiffnesses are\nks=\u221a\n3\n2Y h l2\n0,\nkb=2\u221a\n3D, D =Y h3\n12.(5)\nwhere Yis the Young\u2019s modulus, his the shell thickness, and l0is the mean edge length. These discrete expressions\nare constructed such that, in the limit of mesh refinement, the model recovers the continuum F\u00a8 oppl\u2013von K\u00b4 arm\u00b4 an\nequations for nonlinear thin plates. The three composites have domains \u2126 of 100 mm radius (pattern A), 100 mm \u00d7\n156 mm (pattern B), and 100 mm \u00d7100 mm (pattern C), Figures 2 and 4. With the mesh configurations in Figure 4,\nwe have l0= 3.2 mm, 4 .0 mm, and 5 .8 mm for A, B, and C, respectively. The thicknesses of two layers and their\ncorresponding effective stretching and bending stiffness values, ksandkb, are given in Section II C.\nIn our model, the computational mesh consists of two distinct types of regions, Figure 4 A-C(i): (i) bilayer regions\nB, where both the Shrinky Dink and the inert kirigami layer are present, and (ii) single-layer regions \u2126 \\ B, where\nonly the Shrinky Dink substrate remains (corresponding to the cut-out areas of the kirigami pattern). The material\nproperties \u2013 such as Young\u2019s modulus Y, and consequently the stretching and bending stiffnesses ksandkb\u2013 are\nassigned locally to each mesh element based on its region: bilayer regions use effective properties of the combined\nlayers, while single-layer regions use properties of the Shrinky Dink alone. The specific numerical values used for all\nmaterial parameters are provided in the Section II C.\nWhile the assignment of material properties enables accurate representation of spatial heterogeneity in the composite,\nclassical discrete plate models are limited to flat, stress-free reference states. In contrast, discrete shells extend this\nframework by permitting nonzero natural (rest) curvature, achieved by introducing nonzero rest dihedral angles. This is\nimplemented by replacing the bending term1\n2kb\u03b82\njwith1\n2kb\u0000\n\u03b8j\u2212\u03b8rest\nj\u00012in the energy expression. Such an extension\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n6\nis essential for capturing the permanent, stimulus-induced shape changes observed in our bilayer composites. Building\non these principles, we next present our reduced energy model for programmable composite shells, which incorporates\nstimulus-dependent rest configurations to predict the full range of morphable shapes observed in experiments.\na bc\nd1\n23\n40A(i)               B(i)                       C(i)                    D\ndii\n0\n10mmA(ii)              B(ii)                      C(ii)\nFIG. 4: Reference-configurations meshes for designs A-C in Figures 1 and 2.

Energy Formulation for Stimulus-Responsive Composite Shells\nThe core innovation of our approach is to extend the discrete shells framework so that the elastic energy depends\nexplicitly on both the DOF vector X\u2013 representing the shape of the structure \u2013 and the applied external stimulus,\nsuch as temperature. This enables us to efficiently model the permanent, stimulus-driven morphing of bilayer shells\nusing only a single layer of mesh nodes, without the need for computationally intensive 3D elements. The key physical\nmechanism is the non-uniform thermal strain induced in the bilayer composite: when a 3D-printed PLA pattern is\nbonded to a Shrinky Dink substrate, only the Shrinky Dink contracts under heating, while the PLA remains largely\ninert. This mismatch in planar contraction leads to locally varying natural curvatures \u2013 captured in our model as\nstimulus-dependent rest dihedral angles at the mesh hinges. By properly designing the kirigami pattern, we control\nwhich regions bend and by how much, enabling programmable shape transformation. Building on the framework\nestablished above, we generalize the energy expression in Eq. 4 by allowing the rest dihedral angle \u00af\u03b8jto depend\nexplicitly on the applied thermal stimulus, T.\nIn our reduced model, the total elastic energy is written as\nE(X, T) =NeX\ni=11\n2ks\u0002\n\u03b5i(X)\u2212\u03b5th\ni(T)\u00032+NhX\nj=11\n2kb[\u03b8j(X)\u2212\u03b2l0\u2206\u03b5j(X, T)]2, (6)\nwhere \u03b5th\ni(T) is the stimulus-induced thermal strain in the Shrinky Dink layer (measured from experiments, cf.\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n7\nFigure 3E). The first term accounts for in-plane stretching, while the second term models out-of-plane bending. Here,\n\u03b8j(X) is the dihedral angle at hinge j, and \u03b2l0\u2206\u03b5j(X, T) replaces the rest dihedral angle \u00af\u03b8jin Eq. 4, quantifying the\nlocal mismatch in planar strain across the two triangles sharing each hinge. The parameter \u03b2controls the strength of\nthis coupling and is determined by fitting to experimental data (see Supporting Information for details). Specifically, \u03b2\n(unit m\u22121) denotes the coupling effect per unit triangle-side length, and \u03b2l0gives the coupling strength for a mesh\nwhose triangles have a mean side length l0. For convenience, we set \u03b2= 1/l0here. With this definition, we aim to\ndiminish the dependence of \u03b2on numerical discretization. The explicit expression for \u2206 \u03b5jis provided later in this\nsection. We write \u03b5i(X),\u03b8j(X), and \u2206 \u03b5j(X, T) to emphasize that these quantities are computed from the DOF\nvectorXand, where relevant, the applied stimulus T. Similarly, \u03b5th\ni(T) denotes the thermal strain as a function of T,\ncomputed directly from the experimentally measured contraction of the Shrinky Dink sheet at each temperature (see\nFigure 3E).\nThe thermal strain results from a mismatch caused by shrinkage due to temperature change, is described by\n\u03b5th\npre=\u03b1\u2206T. By observing experimental results, we found that deformation around the boundary of the Shrinky Dink\nsheet is more significant than in the region occupied by the PLA composite. Another contributing factor is the glue\neffect. In some areas, the glue has spread beyond the PLA layer, making the composite stiffer than the pure Shrinky\nDink sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the thermal shrinkage strain increases with the distance from the PLA\nregion, where it remains zero. This variation of thermal strain is given by\n\u03b5th\ni=\u03b5th\npredi\ndmax, d i= min\nj\u2208B\n\nxi\u2212xj\n\n, d max= max\ni\u2208\u2126\\Bdi, (7)\nwhere \u2126 is the set of all edge midpoints in the composite domain.

Physically, \u2206 \u03b5jquantifies the difference in in-plane\ncontraction between the two triangles sharing hinge j, which is the local geometric origin of natural curvature. The\ncorresponding thermal strains, \u03b5th\njp(T), are computed from the experimentally measured contraction of the Shrinky\nDink sheet at each temperature, as reported in Figure 3E.\nThis reduced energy formulation incorporates both the spatial heterogeneity of the composite and the direct influence\nof external stimulus. By minimizing E(X, T) for a given T, we predict the equilibrium 3D shape for any kirigami\ndesign and actuation protocol. The model is validated in the next section by comparison with 3D scans of the fabricated\nstructures.\nC. Numerical Results Validated with Experiments\nThe bilayer composite is modeled as a single-layer elastic shell that incorporates thermal strains and dihedral angles\nas reference strains via the energy, Equation 6. Each region is characterized by its Young\u2019s modulus Y. At room\ntemperature, for the Shrinky Dink sheet, denoted as layer 1, Y1typically ranges from 1GPa to 3GPa [ 28]. For the\n3D-printed PLA layer, denoted as layer 2, Y2ranges from 2GPa to 4GPa [ 29]. However, at a temperature over 300\u25e6F\nwhich is the requirement of the thermal actuation, the modulus becomes around two to three orders of magnitude\nsmaller than their values at room temperature [ 30\u201332]. So we set Y1= 1MPa for the Shrinky Dink, and Y2= 3MPa\nfor the PLA layer. Given the scaling of stiffness and energy are both linear in Young\u2019s modulus, the unit from GPa to\nMPa does not affect the solution to equilibrium. The resulting effective stretching stiffness is [33]\nks=2X\ni=1ki\ns, (9)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n8\nwhere ki\nsfor each layer is given by Equation 5.\nThe relation between flexural rigidity and bending stiffness of a plate is kb= (2/\u221a\n3)D. For a homogeneous plate,\nD=Y h3/12. For a bilayer composite plate, we have the effective flexural rigidity\nD/b=Deff/b=2X\ni=1Yi\u0014h3\ni\n12+hi(yi\u2212\u00afy)2\u0015\n. (10)\nSet the bottom of Shrinky Dink (layer 1) at y= 0, we can define the following for each layer\ny1=h1\n2, y 2=h1+h2\n2, A 1=bh1, A 2=bh2,\nand the location of the bending neutral axis is [33]\n\u00afy=Y1A1y1+Y2A2y2\nY1A1+Y2A2.\nRecall that layer 1 in Equation 10 denotes the Shrinky Dink sheet, and layer 2 denotes the PLA layer. In our\nexperiments, we used thicknesses of h1= 0.3mm for the Shrinky Dink sheet, and h2= 0.7 mm, 0 .6 mm, and 1 .0mm\nfor the PLA layer in patterns A, B, and C in Figure 2, respectively. Since stretching is observed more difficult than\nbending in the experiments, we scaled the Young\u2019s modulus for stretching, and thus ks, up by one order of magnitude.\nWe model the deformation as a static process, solving the equilibrium equations via the Newton-Raphson method.\nThermal actuation is applied in incremental load steps with an adaptive step size chosen to satisfy the convergence\ncriterion |\u2206X|/|X|<10\u22125. Thermal strains are prescribed according to Equation 7, see Section II B 2 for justification.\nBecause the Shrinky Dink layer contracts on heating, the induced thermal strains are negative in sign, \u03f5th\npre<0. To\naccount of practical oven heating, we consider a small, spatially uniform thermal-flux load during the heating process,\nwhich decays to zero by the end of the actuation.\nWe discretize the composite domain into triangular elements, three meshes in the reference configuration are shown\nin Fig. 4. We have verified the finite-difference approximations of the gradient and Hessian of the total energy, and\nthe analytical expressions for both the gradient and Hessian of the energy are given in the Appendix. The numerical\nimplementation was further verified with analytical solutions for uniaxial tension and compression of a simple geometry\ndomain, and the deflection of a cantilever beam under an endpoint load. Complex behaviors, such as bulging and\nnecking also emerge from simple deformation modes [ 34]. Given these verifications, all subsequent simulations are\nobtained with the same numerical implementations.\nA(i)               A(ii)               A(iii)                      A(iv)\nB(i)               B(ii)               B(iii)                      B(iv)\nC(i)               C(ii)               C(iii)                      C(iv)0.40\n0.32\n0.24\n0.16\n0.08\n00\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n-0.6\n|    | Exp.

In each row, (i) shows the experimentally\nscanned shape, (ii) shows the numerical simulation, (iii) shows the distribution of the absolute value of the dihedral angle |\u03b8|,\nand (iv) shows the distribution of the axial strain \u03f5.\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n9\nFigure 5 presents the experimental scans, numerical simulations, and contours of dihedral angle \u03b8and axial strains\n\u03f5for a circular composite with a six-arm PLA pattern, Figure 2A. The term \u201cStimulus\u201d refers to the monotonically\nincreasing stimulus, which is heat here, during the process. From top to bottom, the simulations are in equilibrium\nwith prescribed thermal strains \u03f5th\npre=\u22120.20,\u22120.30 and \u22120.77, respectively. As noted above, these thermal strains are\nnonuniform and vary with each material point\u2019s distance to the PLA pattern. Larger thermally induced shrinkage\nresults in more significant deformations and axial strains. A greater mismatch in axial strains leads to larger dihedral\nangles. To accommodate these deformations, the structure morphs from a planar configuration into a 3D shape.\nDeformation localizes heavily between the arms of the 3D-printed PLA pattern, where the Shrinky Dink layer undergoes\nthe largest shrinkage, indicated by A-C(iii) and A-C(iv) in Figure 5. Overall, excellent agreement is observed between\nthe scanned experimental shapes (first column) and the numerical simulations at each stage of the thermal actuation.\nA(i)               A(ii)               A(iii)                      A(iv)\nB(i)               B(ii)               B(iii)                      B(iv)\nC(i)               C(ii)               C(iii)                      C(iv)0.30\n0.24\n0.18\n0.12\n0.06\n00\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n-0.6\n|    | Exp.

As the prescribed thermal\naxial strain increases over time, the structure develops larger axial strains \u03f5, strains mismatch, dihedral angles \u03b8, and\noverall curvature. Deformation localizes near the four corners of the Shrinky Dink layer. The slight asymmetry in\nthe deformed shapes arises from the mesh used in the numerical simulation and minor anisotropies in the bilayer\ncomposite due to physical manufacturing defects. Nevertheless, the numerical simulations closely approximate the\nscanned experimental results.\nSimilarly, Figure 7 illustrates the deformed configurations at thermally actuated strains \u03f5th\npre=\u22120.10,\u22120.30\nand\u22120.50 for the cross pattern in Figure 2C. As the prescribed thermal strain increases, deformation concentrates\nincreasingly between pattern\u2019s arms. Because the Shrinky Dink layer is square rather than circular, these concentration\nzones form four sharp \u201cpetals\u201d instead of the rounded bowl seen in Figure 5.\nThese three examples demonstrate excellent agreement between scanned experimental 3D shapes and the numerical\nsimulations morphed from 2D planar composites across various domain geometries, patterns, and levels of thermal\nactuation. More complex structures can be achieved by assembling multiple shapes and using multiscale modeling.\nThe substantial computational demand of multiscale modeling across multiple time and length scales can be mitigated\nthrough iterated learning of operators for out-of-distribution data [ 34]. Potential applications of the three examples\ninclude deployable flower petals, bowls, frame-based pillows, canoes, and tent-type structures, each achieved by\nselecting an appropriate reference length scale.\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n10\nA(i)               A(ii)               A(iii)                      A(iv)\nB(i)               B(ii)               B(iii)                      B(iv)\nC(i)               C(ii)               C(iii)                      C(iv)0.70\n0.56\n0.42\n0.28\n0.14\n00.1\n-0.1\n-0.3\n-0.5\n-0.7\n|    | Exp.

Structural similarity index measure\nTo compare the scanned experimental shapes with numerically simulated ones quantitatively, we use the structural\nsimilarity index measure (SSIM), defined at each voxel in a 3D domain. For completeness, we briefly describe our\napplication. We discretize the 3D domain into an Ns\u00d7Ns\u00d7Nsgrid and calculate SSIM at each voxel as [35]\nSSIM =\u0000\n2\u00b51\u00b52+c1\u0001\u0000\n2\u03c312+c2\u0001\n\u0000\n\u00b52\n1+\u00b52\n2+c1\u0001\u0000\n\u03c32\n1+\u03c32\n2+c2\u0001, (11)\nwhere Ns= 10. The voxel intensities are normalized to [0 , Ls], and we use the default parameter values k1= 0.01,\nk2= 0.03,Ls= 1, and ci= (ki\u2217Ls)2fori= 1,2 [35]. Here, \u00b51,\u00b52are local means, \u03c32\n1,\u03c32\n2the variances, and \u03c312\nthe covariance. To make the scanned and simulated shapes comparable, we uniformly scale, translate, and rotate the\nsimulated shapes to align with the scanned experimental data. For our results, the SSIM ranges from 0 to 1, with 0\nindicating no structural correlation and 1 indicating perfect structural similarity.\nFigure 8 summarizes the SSIM between experimental scans and numerical simulations for all three composite\nshapes and their morphing processes. Panels (i) in A-C show a side view of each shapes alongside definition of the\naspect ratio h/d. Panels (ii)-(iv) present top-view SSIM contours at three morphing stages for each geometry through\nA-C. The nine morphing stages are corresponding to the nine stages in Figures 5-7, respectively. Despite anisotropies\nin the Shrinky Dink sheet, glue effects, sharp cut boundaries, and inevitable scanning noise, the SSIM contours show\nclose agreement between simulation and experiment, with most regions appearing in yellow to red.\nIn Figure 8D, solid markers with error bars indicating standard deviations show the evolution of the aspect ratio h/d\nover time during thermal actuation. The entire morphing process completes in approximately 15 seconds, dramatically\nfaster than conventional 3D-shape fabrication methods, which often require minutes to hours. Each pattern exhibits\na slightly different morphing timeline. The six-arm star on the circular sheet (pattern A) begins deforming earliest\nat around 5s, and its h/dplateaus after 12s. The two-star pattern on the rectangular sheet (pattern B) begins to\nmorph latest at around 12s. The cross pattern on the square sheet (pattern C) starts at 7s, and ultimately reaches an\naspect ratio of h/d > 1.2. Hollow markers denote the numerical simulations obtained by prescribing thermal strains as\ndescribed in Sections II B 2 and II C. Figure 8E plots the mean SSIM values for the nine SSIM contour plots shown\nin panels (ii)-(iv). The mean SSIM is simply the arithmetic mean SSIM =1\nN3sPNs\ni=1PNs\nj=1PNs\nk=1SSIM (i, j, k ). All\nmean SSIM values are around 0.8, indicating close agreement between the numerical simulations and the scanned\nexperimental shapes.\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n11\nA(i)           A(ii)       A(iii)       A(iv)\nhd\nB(i)           B(ii)       B(iii)       B(iv)\n00.20.40.60.8 1SSIMd\nh\nC(i)           C(ii)       C(iii)       C(iv)\nd\nhStimulus\nA B C00.20.40.60.81mean SSIMD\nE\nAspect Ratio, h/d\nA(ii)\nB(ii)\nC(ii)A(iii)\nB(iii)\nC(iii)A(iv)\nB(iv)\nC(iv)Time, t(s)024681012141600.511.5\nA Exp.\nB Exp.\nC Exp.A Sim.\nB Sim.\nC Sim.\nFIG. 8: Validation of numerical simulations against experimental results using SSIM.

CONCLUSION\nWe introduced a new energy formulation for reduced-order modeling of composites as a single layer material, enabling\nefficient simulation of stimulus-driven morphing across a broad range of systems beyond bilayers. The formulation\ncouples out-of-plane bending with in-plane stretching, expressed as functions of the applied stimulus, allowing accurate\nmodeling of permanent and stimulus-induced deformations.\nWe also developed a robust fabrication protocol to transform planar composites into 3D structures via thermal\nactuation, achieving a repeatable success rate exceeding 90%. Three representative geometries \u2013 a six-arm star on a\ncircle, a two-star on a rectangle, and a cross on a square \u2013 showed excellent agreement between numerical simulations\nand experiments across various morphing stages, as evidenced by both qualitative comparisons in Figures 1, 5-7, and\nquantitative SSIM values in Figure 8.\nThe close agreement between simulations from our reduced-order model and experiments highlights the predictive\npower and broad potential for fast, low-cost, and precise design and manufacturing of complex structures through\nemergent morphogenesis.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nMaterials and Methods : We used commercially available Shrinky Dink polystyrene sheets (Cridoz Shrinky Art Paper\nSheets) and 3D-printed PLA kirigami inspired patterns. The kirigami components were designed using Fusion 360\nand SolidWorks CAD software [ 36], utilizing Python scripts to rapidly assign and vary geometry. The designs were\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n12\nfabricated with a fused deposition modelling 3D printer (Bambu Lab 1PS) using PLA filament chosen for its thermal\nresistance during oven experimentation and its mechanical properties. Adhesion between layers was achieved using a\ntwo-part Gorilla epoxy adhesive, selected for its bond strength, thermal stability, cost, and ease of use.\nShrinky Dink Properties : Shrinky Dink is a thermoplastic polystyrene polymer that exhibits isotropic in-plane\nshrinkage when heated. We define the shrink ratio as L/L 0, where Lis the instantaneous length and L0is the original\nlength. Figure 3 shows the variation of normalized length\u0000\nL/L 0\u0001\nwith normalized temperature T/Tg. The shrink\nratio decreases with increasing temperature and plateaus once T/Tgexceeds 1.15, indicating isotropic behavior as the\nshrink ratios along orthogonal in-plane directions converge. Above 300\u25e6F, the x- and y-axis gauge lengths coincide\nand the standard deviation bars contract, reflecting highly reproducible shrinkage. To ensure uniform and predictable\nactuation, all subsequent experiments were conducted within this temperature regime.\nManufacturing Protocol : The fabrication followed four key steps:\n1. Print the 3D kirigami design on a fused deposition modeling printer.\n2. Bond the 3D printed kirigami elements to pre-cut Shrinky Dink sheets with a thin, uniform layer of epoxy.\n3. Cure under distributed weight (6 .8\u00d7102N/m2) for 24 h at room temperature to ensure full adhesion.\n4.Thermally activate the composite in a laboratory oven preheated to 300\u25e6F. Each sample was placed with the\nShrinky Dink side facing down on a non-stick foil base and heated for 15s. The 3D morphing process was\nobserved visually, and samples were removed by hand immediately upon full shape transformation.\nPattern Design and Results : Morphing samples were generated via a Python script that produced random polygonal\nkirigami patterns on a 2D domain. Visual inspection of the resulting 3D shapes revealed that local curvature propagated\nalong the printed line directions. In a parametric study, we varied three parameters: line width, PLA layer thickness,\nand line count per polygon. Empirically, increasing line count yielded smoother and more continuous circumferential\ncurvature, whereas fewer lines produced segmented outlines. Thicker and wider PLA lines resisted actuation, requiring\nlonger oven exposure due to higher bending and stretching stiffness. Consequently, designs with more than four lines\nwere adopted for rapid, reliable thermal response and consistent circumferential curvature across samples. Three planar\npatterns were therefore designed to benchmark the aforementioned observations and to investigate the numerical\naccuracy of simulations in comparison to the experimentally fabricated patterns. They are: A. Single-star : Fabricated\nby intersecting three coplanar \u201carms\u201d, each 90 mmlong, at 60\u25e6increments through the centroid, generating six 45 mm\nradial arms. B. Double-star : Superimposed two such stars aligned coaxially, separated by a 56 .73mmspine, giving\nan overall tip-to-tip length of 146 .7mm. C.Orthogonal X-cross : Incorporating four arms spaced at 90\u25e6intervals,\neach extending 56 .7mmfrom the center of the shape and spanning 99 .99mmalong the principal diagonal, with each\narm chamfered at its end via the addition of a right-angled triangle.\nComputational Reconstruction : The computational reconstruction utilized Polycam photogrammetry software\nalongside a high-resolution camera and a custom-printed stand to capture 80 images around each sample from multiple\nangles. These images were processed in Polycam to generate and edit 3D models in STL and OBJ formats. To\nenhance reconstruction consistency and spatial accuracy, we applied fiduciary markers to the samples prior to imaging,\nfacilitating reliable feature recognition and reducing computation time [ 37]. The resulting meshes were scaled to\nreal-world dimensions based on known physical measurements and subsequently 3D-printed to validate scale fidelity\nagainst experimental results.\nAspect Ratio : To extract the mean aspect ratio of each experimental sample, we conducted a frame-by-frame analysis\nat 1 s intervals using a high resolution video of the thermal actuation procedure. Frames were imported into ImageJ\n[38], where a threshold mask isolated the sample from the background for accurate perimeter and geometry detection.\nThe straight-line tool was used to manually define key dimensions, whose pixel lengths were recorded. Conversion\nfrom pixels to physical units was performed using a known reference length inside the oven. From these measurements,\nin-plane shrinkage and out-of-plane height expansion were computed and expressed as the numerical aspect ratio h/d,\nas demonstrated in Figure 8.\nSupporting Information\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.
